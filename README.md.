# Project Title
Predictive Modelling For COVID-19 In Public Health

## Project Overview
This project involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Merging**:  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
   - Merge multiple datasets into a unified format.  
   - The final cleaned datasets are saved in the `data/cleaned/` and `data/merged/` folders.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to explore the data.  
   - Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends using various plotting techniques.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Train machine learning models using the cleaned data.  
   - Evaluate models' performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, or RMSE.  
   - The final models are saved in the `models/` folder.

## Folder Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw, cleaned, and merged datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Google Colab Notebook for data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for automation of cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models (e.g., `.pkl` files).
- **results/**: Visualizations and reports generated during analysis.

## Requirements
